## Functional Requirements

- **Bottom Navigation**: Users are presented with a bottom navigation UI with “Jobs” and “Bookmarks” as sections.
- **Jobs Screen**: Fetches data from an API with infinite scroll. Displays job title, location, salary, and phone number.
- **Job Details**: Clicking on a job card navigates to a screen showing more details about the job.
- **Bookmark Jobs**: Users can bookmark jobs, and these will appear in the “Bookmarks” tab.
- **Offline Storage**: All bookmarked jobs are stored locally for offline viewing.
- **State Management**: Handles appropriate states for loading, errors, and empty states throughout the app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Module Not Found Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and properly linked.
- **Bookmark Not Showing**: Verify that bookmarks are being saved and retrieved correctly. Ensure local storage is functioning.
